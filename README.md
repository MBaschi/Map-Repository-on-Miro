The aim of the project is to createa miro board to visualize the structure of a folder or an application written in python. This is usefull to have a initial board in wich to take note about the folder/ files/ code of the application.
Given a path to a local folder and created a miro developer board, the program cycle trough the folder and send requests to plot elements with their names as rectangle.

HOW TO
- Create a miro developer board by following the tutorial: https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth
- Save the token and url (or id) of the board
- Copy the repo on local with git clone
- Insert the path to the folder, the miro token and board id in the config file
- Run the main

If the steps are folowed correctly the board would be popolated with rectangle representing the different elements (folder, files, python classes inside the file)
It may be necessasry to move the around the board and zoom out to find the map (maybe the view is not in the correct initial position)
